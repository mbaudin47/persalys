Source Installation
=================

Before trying to compile and install the software, be sure to get access to some
mandatory tools the module relies upon. These are (at least):
 * CMake
 * SWIG
 * Python

For the quick readers:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local ..
make install
make check
make installcheck

Don't skip the check stages. They ensure you the software you've just compiled behaves correctly.
