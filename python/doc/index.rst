=================================

User documentation
------------------

This documentation is made to guide the user to perform uncertainty studies thanks to the
interface for OpenTURNS. The user manual aims at describing how the interface is working
and what are all its functionalities. This manual explains also how the user can manually
create and manipulate objects from the software thanks to the Python language. It lists
all the objects and their methods and details their use and their arguments.
The examples guide provides some studies illustrating the use of the interface.
